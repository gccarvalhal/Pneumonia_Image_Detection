# Pneumonia Image Detection

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:** 
Exploration CNNâ€™s applications on chest Xray images for a classification task, including full implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks and the Vision Transformer. Also, it was applied techniques of transfer learning and finetuning for the models VGG-16, VGG-19, and ResNet-50. Therefore, it was suggested an ensemble method for increasing the robustness and performance of Pneumonia detection and it was evaluated all the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
